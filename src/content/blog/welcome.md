# Welcome to My New Site!

I'm excited to launch my new portfolio and blog built with **Astro** and integrated with **Notion**. This setup gives me the best of both worlds:

## Why Astro?

- ⚡ **Lightning fast** - Static generation with minimal JavaScript
- 🎨 **Beautiful** - Tailwind CSS for styling
- 📱 **Responsive** - Mobile-first design
- 🚀 **Easy deployment** - GitHub Pages integration

## Notion Integration

The real magic happens with Notion integration:

- ✍️ Write articles in Notion's familiar interface
- 📊 Organize content with databases
- 🔄 Automatic sync via GitHub Actions
- 📝 Rich text, code blocks, and media support

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing thoughts on:
- iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI
- App architecture and best practices
- New projects and experiments

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
